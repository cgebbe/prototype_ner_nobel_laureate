Ragnar Anton Kittil Frisch (3 March 1895 – 31 January 1973) was an influential Norwegian economist known for being one of the major contributors to establishing economics as a quantitative and statistically informed science in the early 20th century. He was the first to develop a statistically informed model of business cycles in 1933. Later work on the model together with Jan Tinbergen won the two the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969.[6],6,"[{""start"": 436, ""end"": 453, ""text"": ""Economic Sciences"", ""labels"": [""FIELD""]}]",1,5,2022-01-05T07:00:19.699412Z,2022-01-05T07:00:19.699442Z,8.384
